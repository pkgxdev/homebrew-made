# pkgx Tap

We package [`pkgm`], [`dev`] and [`mash`] for Homebrew.

```sh
brew install pkgxdev/made/pkgm
# ^^ https://github.com/pkgxdev/pkgm

brew install pkgxdev/made/dev
# ^^ https://github.com/pkgxdev/dev

brew install pkgxdev/made/mash
# ^^ https://github.com/pkgxdev/mash
```

> [!NOTE]
>
> `pkgx` has an official Homebrew formula:
>
> ```sh
> brew install pkgx
> ```
>
> We continue to publish `pkgx` to our tap for users who have tapped it
> previously, but do not recommend it for new users.
